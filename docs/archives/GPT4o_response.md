Yes. This is **exactly** what needs to happen next. You’re locking in trust before asking users to commit — and that’s the right UX for a tool claiming to be a failsafe.

---

## 🔥 Let’s build the next milestone around:

### ✅ 1. `bml status` update:

Add per-tracked-folder status that includes:

- Path
- Where snapshots are stored (`~/.blackmirror_lite/mirrors/…`)
- Last 3 actions (snapshot, ignored, etc.)

#### Output Example:

```text
Tracking: /mnt/c/ADAPTiQ_SaaS/ADAPTiQ
Backups: ~/.blackmirror_lite/mirrors/mnt__c__ADAPTiQ_SaaS__ADAPTiQ
Last 3 actions:
[💾] 12:03:04 | snapshot | main.py (2.1 KB)
[💾] 12:03:11 | snapshot | worker.py (4.5 KB)
[📈] 12:03:21 | ignored  | logs/telemetry.db
```

We’ll pipe in a rotating queue/log and mirror directory map during `track`.

### ✅ 2. `bml prove-it` (or `bml show-me`, `bml verify`, etc.)

This is a **user-trust demonstration** — not just a test.

#### Behavior:

- Creates a temp test folder like `~/.blackmirror_lite/demo`
- Adds a fake file `demo.py`, writes `print(1)`
- Waits 2s, writes `print(2)`
- Waits 2s, writes `print(3)`
- Calls `jump-back 3s`
- Confirms that file contains only `print(2)`
- Reports ✔ PASS or ✖ FAIL
- If fail: print a friendly snark:

```text
Well shit. You just found an edge case. Open an issue and brag about it:
https://github.com/Dcamy/ADAPTiQ/issues
```

#### Bonus:

- Include a `--silent` mode for headless Codex-style runs
- Or `--show` to tail logs live during the test

---

### ✅ 3. Auto-run `prove-it` on first launch

When a user runs `bml` for the first time (e.g. no mirror folders exist), trigger:

```python
if not any(os.listdir(mirror_dir)):
    run_prove_it_demo()
```

And let them know:

```text
Running initial snapshot test to prove BlackMirror works...
(This only happens once. Promise.)
```

---

### ✅ 4. Update `--help`

Add:

```
  prove-it             Run a self-contained demo proving snapshot/rollback works
  status               Show tracking status, mirror paths, recent actions
```

### 🧠 TL;DR Implementation Plan

| Task                | Type     | Notes                                   |
| ------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `bml status`        | CLI      | Shows backup path + recent actions      |
| `bml prove-it`      | CLI demo | Creates + rolls back dummy changes      |
| Auto-run prove-it   | UX boost | Only on first install (no tracked dirs) |
| `--help` updates    | Polish   | Adds new verbs to help screen           |
| Issue link in error | UX/viral | Encourages feedback with style          |

### ✅ Next prompt to feed Codex

Here’s what to paste:

```plaintext
Add a new CLI command to blackmirror_lite called `prove-it`.

When a user runs `bml prove-it`, it should:
1. Create a test folder at ~/.blackmirror_lite/demo
2. Create a file demo.py inside it with "print(1)"
3. Start tracking that folder
4. Wait 2 seconds, write "print(2)"
5. Wait 2 more seconds, write "print(3)"
6. Call `jump-back 3s`
7. Read back demo.py. If it contains "print(2)", print "✅ BlackMirror works"
8. If anything fails, print "❌ Well shit. You found an edge case. Open an issue at https://github.com/Dcamy/ADAPTiQ/issues"

Also:
- Add this command to `--help`
- Add a `status` command that shows tracked folders, where their backups live, and the last 3 logged events
- Autodetect first-time use (no mirrors) and run `prove-it` automatically

Do NOT use git. Do NOT skip the writes. Do NOT simplify this into a dummy test — the file changes and rollback should be real.
```

Ready to push the patch for all that? Want me to just generate the whole updated `__main__.py` with these commands built in?
